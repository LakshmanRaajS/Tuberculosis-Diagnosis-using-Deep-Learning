# Tuberculosis-Diagnosis-using-Deep-Learning
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a deep learning strategy that has gained attention and popularity due to its ability to learn midlevel as well as high-level image representations. In this work, several models such as InceptionV3, VGG19, ResNet50, and Xception were used, which classify the chest radiographs into TB positive and TB negative classes. This paper offers a comparative study on the various deep learning techniques that can process chest x-rays and are capable of TB detection. The performance of the system is measured on a publicly available dataset: Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Database. The proposed CNN models trained for TB detection achieve accuracy of more than 80%, with the highest percent accuracy being at 98%.
